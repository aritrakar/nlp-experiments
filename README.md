# nlp-experiments

In this repository, I store some NLP models I have experimented with using Tensorflow. The models perform different tasks as follows:

1. Sarcasm detection from news headlines: `discovery.ipynb`
2. Generate (not-so-coherent) Irish songs: `discovery.ipynb`
3. Generate songs in the style of Imagine Dragons: `songs.ipynb` (IN PROGRESS)

I'm new to this field and am learning a lot. Any feedback is appreciated!
